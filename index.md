## üìΩÔ∏è 1. AIML - End-to-end Movie Recommendation System

A hybrid movie recommendation system built using **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**, deployed as an interactive web application with **Streamlit**:

## **Key Features**

- **Customizable Hybrid Recommendations**:
   - Adjust weights for content-based and collaborative filtering to get tailored results.

- **Efficient Memory Usage**:
   - Precomputed cosine similarity matrix stored in a FAISS vector store for content-based filtering.
   - Optimized SVD for collaborative filtering.

- **Interactive Interface**:
   - Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

üîó **Live demo:** [View App](https://movielens-3fxvogxfzafxcvmfccfbrd.streamlit.app/) 
üíª **Source code:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cdondi/aiml_movie_recommendation)

1. **Enter a Movie Title**:
   - Input a movie title (e.g., `"Toy Story (1995)"`) to get recommendations.

2. **Optionally Enter a User ID**:
   - Provide a user ID to personalize recommendations using collaborative filtering.

3. **Adjust Weights**:
   - Use the sliders to control the balance between content-based and collaborative recommendations.

4. **Set Number of Recommendations**:
   - Choose how many recommendations to display.

5. **View Results**:
   - The app displays a list of recommended movies based on the inputs and settings.

This project is an end-to-end machine learning system to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business. The goal is to identify users who are likely to cancel their service soon so that retention teams can take proactive action.:

## **Key Features**

- **Tenure buckets and binary flags**:
   - .

- **One-hot encoding for categorical features**:
   - .

- **Feature interactions (tenure/charges)**:
   - .
 
- **Resampling for class imbalance**:
   - .
 
- **Threshold tuning**:
